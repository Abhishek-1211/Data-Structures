# Data Structures and Algorithms
 - This repo contains solutions to leetcode questions as I continue to practice.
 - I will try to post  atleast 2-3 questions on daily basis.
 - In this repo i have also tried latest fetaures of java like instance main methods- 
   whereby main method acts as entry point of java program.This is currently in DP programs
 - Topics covered - Arrays, linkedlist,Stack,Queue, Trees, Graph,Dynamic Programming, etc.
